![Version][version-image]
![License][license-image]

With this config you can make sure that all developers in your team have the same basic settings for VSCode. Individual settings of each team member will not be overwritten.

<br>

## Installation

Add this package as a devDependency to your project:

```
yarn add --dev @4th-motion/vscode-config
```

<br>

## Usage

Once the package is installed, you can initiate it with:

```
yarn 4th-vscode
```

<br>

## Behind the scenes

The initialization process copies [vscode/settings.json](/vscode/settings.json) and [vscode/extenstions.json](/vscode/extenstions.json) from this repository to your project. If the files already exist, the contents are merged.

<br>

## Customize to your needs

You can rename this project to `@company/vscode-config` to tailor it to your cooporate. To change the name of the initialization process, you must modify the fields within `bin` in the _package.json_ file as follows:

```json
{
  "bin": {
    "company-vscode": "./index.js"
  }
}
```
